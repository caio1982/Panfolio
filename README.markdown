Panfolio
--------

Panfolio is a tiny Python script to generate a nice simple gallery of all your (say, vacations) pictures. The only reason I wrote this was to get a free coffee on @artmello, who happens to be quite lazy to organize his photos :-)

Pros
====

- as fast and as simple as it could get
- renders fine in tablets and phones
- your pictures matter, no cluttering
- addthis' support to share cat pictures
- elegant!

Cons
====

- you tell me!

Pending
-------

- caching, maybe?
